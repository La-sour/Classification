 Classification using Fashion MNIST with support callbacks
We learned how to do classificaiton using Fashion MNIST. Classification using Fashion MNIST with support callbacks. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of zalando's article images-consisting of a training set of 60.000 example and test set of 10.000 example, each example is a 28 x 28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

Now, i use support callbacks, i can callback to a code function, having checked the metrics. i will implement the on epoch_end function, which gets called by the callback whenever the epoch ends.
